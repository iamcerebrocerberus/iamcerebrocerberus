# Hi, I’m Seth Mensah 👋

Backend-focused Software Engineer who builds clean, maintainable systems with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and long-term sustainability.

I care about designing software that is easy to understand, easy to change, and reliable in real-world use. I enjoy solving real problems, choosing tools based on context, and helping others learn along the way. I’m passionate about **community building** and teaching fellow developers to grow and collaborate.
